# Programming on R for Business-Analytics
Personal data analysis project on laptop market made in school.

The subjects, questions and analysis are all mine. The purpose of this subject was to analyze a dataset from Kaggle and deduce from it the best laptops of the market, so the consumers can easily head towards the laptop with the features they need for their budget but also for the manufacturers so they can better understand the needs of the customers.
